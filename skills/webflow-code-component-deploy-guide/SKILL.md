# Deploy Guide

Guide users through deploying their code component library to Webflow.

## When to Use This Skill

**Use when:**
- User is ready to deploy components to Webflow
- User asks how to share, publish, or deploy their library
- First-time deployment to a workspace
- Step-by-step deployment walkthrough needed

**Do NOT use when:**
- Deployment failed (use troubleshoot-deploy instead)
- Just validating before deploy (use pre-deploy-check instead)
- Setting up local development (use local-dev-setup instead)

**Note:** The CLI command is `webflow library share`. This skill uses "deploy" as the user-facing term.

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Pre-Flight Checks

1. **Verify project is ready**:
   - Check webflow.json configuration
   - Ensure all dependencies installed
   - Run pre-deploy-check skill checks

2. **Check authentication status**:
   - Look for existing .env with API token
   - Verify WEBFLOW_WORKSPACE_API_TOKEN if set
   - Prepare for authentication if needed

3. **Confirm deployment target**:
   - Which workspace?
   - New library or update existing?

### Phase 2: Authentication

4. **Guide authentication**:
   - Interactive: Follow CLI prompts
   - CI/CD: Use --api-token flag
   - Show how to get workspace API token if needed

### Phase 3: Deployment

5. **Execute deployment**:
   - Run `npx webflow library share`
   - Monitor for errors
   - Capture output

### Phase 4: Verification

6. **Verify deployment**:
   - Check Webflow Designer for components
   - Test component functionality
   - Confirm all components appear

7. **Provide next steps**:
   - How to use components in Designer
   - How to update in future
   - Common post-deploy tasks
   - If deployment fails, use [troubleshoot-deploy](../troubleshoot-deploy/SKILL.md) to diagnose and fix issues

## Deployment Workflow

---

## Step 1: Pre-Flight Checks

Running validation...

✅ webflow.json configured
✅ Dependencies installed
✅ Build succeeds
✅ Bundle size: 2.3MB (under 50MB limit)

All checks passed! Ready to deploy.

---

## Step 2: Authentication

**Option A: Interactive (Recommended for first time)**

Run the deploy command:
```bash
npx webflow library share
```

This will:
1. Open your browser for Webflow login
2. Ask you to authorize the app
3. Save credentials to .env

**Option B: API Token (For CI/CD or returning users)**

1. Get your Workspace API Token:
   - Go to Webflow Dashboard
   - Navigate to your Workspace Settings
   - Find "Apps & Integrations" → "Manage"
   - Under "Workspace API Access", click "Generate API Token"
   - Copy the token

2. Run with token:
```bash
npx webflow library share --api-token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

Or set environment variable:
```bash
export WEBFLOW_WORKSPACE_API_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
npx webflow library share
```

---

## Step 3: Deploy

Ready to deploy? Run:

```bash
npx webflow library share
```

Expected output:
```
✓ Bundling components...
✓ Authenticating...
✓ Uploading library...
✓ Processing...

Library "My Component Library" successfully shared!

Components:
- Button
- Card
- Accordion
- Modal

View in Designer: Open any site in your workspace
```

---

## Step 4: Verify in Designer

After deployment:

1. **Open Webflow Designer** for any site in your workspace
2. **Open Add Panel** (A key or + button)
3. **Find "Components"** section
4. **Look for your library** under custom components
5. **Drag a component** onto the canvas to test

---

## Step 5: Next Steps

✅ **Your components are live!**

**To update components later:**
```bash
# Make your changes, then re-deploy
npx webflow library share
```

**Important notes:**
- Updates replace the entire library (no partial updates)
- Existing component instances will update automatically
- Don't rename .webflow.tsx files (breaks instances)

---

💡 **Tips:**
- Add .env to .gitignore to protect your token
- Use `--verbose` flag for debugging issues
- Run `npx webflow library log` to see recent deploy logs
```

## Step 1: Get Workspace API Token

You'll need a Workspace API token to deploy:

1. **Open Webflow Dashboard**
   Go to webflow.com and log in

2. **Navigate to Workspace Settings**
   Click your workspace name → Settings

3. **Find API Access**
   Go to "Apps & Integrations" → "Manage"

4. **Generate Token**
   Under "Workspace API Access":
   - Click "Generate API Token"
   - Copy the token (you won't see it again!)

5. **Save Token**
   Add to your .env file:
   ```
   WEBFLOW_WORKSPACE_API_TOKEN=your-token-here
   ```

   ⚠️ Add .env to .gitignore:
   ```bash
   echo ".env" >> .gitignore
   ```

---

## Step 2: Deploy

Now run:
```bash
npx webflow library share
```

The CLI will:
1. Read your token from .env
2. Bundle your components
3. Upload to your workspace

---

## Step 3: Verify

After successful deploy:

1. Open Webflow Designer
2. Press 'A' to open Add panel
3. Find your components in the Components section
4. Drag onto canvas to test

---

🎉 **First deployment complete!**

Future deployments are simpler:
```bash
# Just run this after making changes
npx webflow library share
```
```

## GitHub Actions Example

Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Webflow

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Deploy to Webflow
        env:
          WEBFLOW_WORKSPACE_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.WEBFLOW_WORKSPACE_API_TOKEN }}
        run: npx webflow library share --no-input
```

---

## Add Secret to GitHub

1. Go to your repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Name: `WEBFLOW_WORKSPACE_API_TOKEN`
4. Value: Your workspace API token
5. Click "Add secret"

---

## Key Flags for CI/CD

```bash
npx webflow library share --no-input
```

- `--no-input`: Disables interactive prompts
- Uses `WEBFLOW_WORKSPACE_API_TOKEN` env var automatically

---

## Optional: Add TypeScript Check

```yaml
- name: Type check
  run: npx tsc --noEmit
```

---

✅ **CI/CD configured!**

Now every push to main will automatically deploy your components.
```

## Validation

After deployment, verify success with these checks:

| Check | How to Verify |
|-------|---------------|
| Deploy completed | `npx webflow library share` exited without errors |
| Components visible | Open Designer Add panel → find your library |
| Import logs clean | `npx webflow library log` shows successful import |
| Bundle size OK | Output shows bundle under 50MB |
| Props work | Drag component onto canvas, verify props in right panel |

## Guidelines

### Terminology

The CLI command is `webflow library share`. This skill uses "deploy" as the user-facing term for consistency with common developer vocabulary. See the [CLI reference](../../references/CODE_COMPONENTS_REFERENCE.md) (Section 12) for full command documentation.

### Authentication Methods

| Method | Use Case | Command |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Interactive | First time, local dev | `npx webflow library share` |
| Environment variable | CI/CD, automation | Set `WEBFLOW_WORKSPACE_API_TOKEN` |
| CLI flag | One-off with different token | `--api-token TOKEN` |

### Pre-Deploy Checklist

Before every deployment:

- [ ] `npm install` is up to date
- [ ] Build succeeds locally
- [ ] Bundle under 50MB
- [ ] All component tests pass
- [ ] No SSR-breaking code (or ssr: false set)
- [ ] Props have default values where supported (not available for Link, Image, Slot, ID)

### Common Deploy Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Authentication failed" | Invalid/expired token | Regenerate workspace token |
| "Bundle too large" | Over 50MB | Optimize dependencies |
| "Library not found" | Wrong workspace | Check token workspace |
| "Build failed" | Code errors | Fix compilation errors |

### CLI Flags Reference

All flags for `npx webflow library share`:

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--manifest` | Path to `webflow.json` file | Scans current directory |
| `--api-token` | Workspace API token | Uses `WEBFLOW_WORKSPACE_API_TOKEN` from `.env` |
| `--no-input` | Skip interactive prompts (for CI/CD) | No |
| `--verbose` | Display more debugging information | No |
| `--dev` | Bundle in development mode (no minification) | No |

### Rollback & Versioning

- Each `library share` replaces the **entire** library — there are no partial updates
- There is **no built-in rollback** — use git to revert changes and re-deploy
- **Never rename `.webflow.tsx` files** — renaming creates a new component and removes the old one, breaking all existing instances in projects

### Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check recent deploy logs
npx webflow library log

# Verbose deploy output (detailed errors)
npx webflow library share --verbose

# Local bundle verification (catches build errors before deploying)
npx webflow library bundle --public-path http://localhost:4000/
```

### CI/CD Deployment

The GitHub Actions example above applies to any CI system. The key elements are:

```bash
# Generic CI pattern:
npm ci                                        # Install dependencies
npx webflow library share --no-input          # Deploy without prompts
# Requires WEBFLOW_WORKSPACE_API_TOKEN env var
```

### Post-Deploy Verification

Always verify after deployment:

1. **Check Designer**: Components appear in Add panel
2. **Test drag-and-drop**: Component renders on canvas
3. **Test props**: Props editable in right panel
4. **Test preview**: Component works in preview mode
5. **Test publish**: Component works on published site
