# Site Audit

Comprehensive audit of a Webflow site's structure, content health, and quality with detailed analysis and multiple export formats.

## Important Note

**ALWAYS use Webflow MCP tools for all operations:**
- Use Webflow MCP's `data_sites_tool` with action `list_sites` for listing available sites
- Use Webflow MCP's `data_sites_tool` with action `get_site` for detailed site information
- Use Webflow MCP's `data_pages_tool` with action `list_pages` for retrieving all pages
- Use Webflow MCP's `data_cms_tool` with action `get_collection_list` for listing CMS collections
- Use Webflow MCP's `data_cms_tool` with action `get_collection_details` for detailed collection schemas
- Use Webflow MCP's `data_cms_tool` with action `list_collection_items` for counting items
- Use Webflow MCP's `webflow_guide_tool` to get best practices before starting
- DO NOT use any other tools or methods for Webflow operations
- All tool calls must include the required `context` parameter (15-25 words, third-person perspective)

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Site Selection & Discovery
1. **Get site**: Identify the target site. If user does not provide site ID, ask for it.
2. **Fetch site details**: Use Webflow MCP's `data_sites_tool` with action `get_site` to retrieve:
   - Site name and ID
   - Last published date
   - Last updated date
   - Timezone
   - Locales (primary and secondary)
   - Custom domains
3. **Ask user preferences**: Ask what level of detail they want:
   - Quick summary (counts only)
   - Standard inventory (pages + collections + counts)
   - Detailed inventory (includes all field schemas, item samples, SEO data)
   - Full export (everything + export to file format)

### Phase 2: Pages Inventory
4. **List all pages**: Use Webflow MCP's `data_pages_tool` with action `list_pages` to fetch all pages
5. **Categorize pages**:
   - Static pages (no collectionId)
   - CMS template pages (has collectionId)
   - Archived pages
   - Draft pages
6. **Analyze page structure**:
   - Count pages by type
   - Identify pages missing SEO metadata
   - Detect orphaned pages (no navigation links)
   - Check for duplicate slugs

### Phase 3: CMS Collections Inventory
7. **List all collections**: Use Webflow MCP's `data_cms_tool` with action `get_collection_list`
8. **For each collection**:
   - Get detailed schema using Webflow MCP's `data_cms_tool` with action `get_collection_details`
   - Count items using Webflow MCP's `data_cms_tool` with action `list_collection_items`
   - Analyze field types and requirements
   - Identify required vs optional fields
   - Detect reference fields and relationships
9. **Collection analysis**:
   - Empty collections (0 items)
   - Unused collections (no template page)
   - Large collections (100+ items)
   - Collections with missing required fields

### Phase 4: Analysis & Insights
10. **Generate insights**:
    - Total content count (pages + items)
    - Content health score
    - SEO readiness
    - Recommended improvements
11. **Identify issues**:
    - Missing SEO metadata
    - Empty collections
    - Orphaned pages
    - Draft content ratio
12. **Show relationships**:
    - Which pages use which collections
    - Reference field connections
    - Content dependencies

### Phase 5: Export & Formatting
13. **Ask export format** (if user wants full export):
    - Markdown (readable, great for documentation)
    - JSON (machine-readable, for migrations)
    - CSV (spreadsheet-friendly, for analysis)
    - Text summary (console output only)
14. **Generate report** in requested format
15. **Provide actionable insights**: Suggest next steps based on findings

### Phase 5: Export Formats

**Markdown Export:**
```markdown
# Site Audit: [Site Name]

## Site Information
- ID: [site-id]
- Last Published: [date]

## Pages
### Static Pages
- Home (/)
- About (/about)

### CMS Templates
- Blog Post (/post/[slug])

## Collections
### Blog Posts (47 items)
**Fields:**

...
```

**JSON Export:**
```json
{

**CSV Export:**
Generate separate files:
- `pages.csv`: All pages with metadata
- `collections.csv`: Collection metadata
- `fields.csv`: All fields across collections
- `items.csv`: Item counts per collection

### Performance Optimization

**Batch Processing:**
- For sites with 20+ collections, show progress
- For collections with 100+ items, paginate counts
- Provide estimated time for large sites

**Error Handling:**
- If `data_pages_tool` with action `list_pages` fails, continue with collections
- If `data_cms_tool` with action `get_collection_details` fails, show basic collection info
- Report partial successes separately
- Offer to retry failed operations

**Data Efficiency:**
- Use pagination for large result sets
- Only fetch detailed schemas when needed
- Limit item samples to 3-5 per collection
- Cache site info for repeat operations

### Best Practices

**Read-Only Operation:**
- No confirmation needed (read-only)
- Safe to run multiple times
- No side effects or modifications

**Clear Organization:**
- Group by content type (pages/collections)
- Use visual hierarchy (├── └──)
- Show counts prominently
- Highlight issues with icons (✅ ⚠️ 🔴 💡)

**Actionable Output:**
- Always end with recommendations
- Offer export options for detailed inventories
- Suggest next steps based on findings
- Provide comparison against best practices

**Version Tracking:**
If user runs inventory multiple times:
- Compare with previous run
- Show changes (new pages, deleted collections)
- Track content growth over time
- Alert on significant changes
