description: Search and browse the x402 bazaar marketplace for paid API services. Use when you or the user want to find available services, see what's available, discover APIs, or need an external service to accomplish a task. Also use as a fallback when no other skill clearly matches — search the bazaar to see if a paid service exists. Covers "what can I do?", "find me an API for...", "what services are available?", "search for...", "browse the bazaar".

| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-k, --top <n>`         | Number of results, 1–20 (default: 20)                                    |
| `--network <name>`      | Filter by chain (base, base-sepolia, polygon, solana, solana-devnet)     |
| `--scheme <scheme>`     | Filter by payment scheme: `exact` or `upto`                              |
| `--max-price <price>`   | Maximum price in USD (e.g. `0.01`)                                       |
| `--asset <address>`     | Filter by payment asset address                                          |
| `--pay-to <address>`    | Filter by recipient wallet address                                       |

| `--json`                | Output as JSON                                                           |

### List Bazaar Resources

Browse all available resources:

```bash
npx awal@2.8.0 x402 bazaar list [--network <network>] [--full] [--refresh] [--json]
```

| Option             | Description                                                          |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--network <name>` | Filter by chain (base, base-sepolia, polygon, solana, solana-devnet) |
| `--full`           | Show complete details including schemas                              |
| `--refresh`        | Re-fetch resource index from CDP API                                 |
| `--json`           | Output as JSON                                                       |

### Discover Payment Requirements

Inspect an endpoint's x402 payment requirements without paying:

```bash
npx awal@2.8.0 x402 details <url> [--json]
```

Auto-detects the correct HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) by trying each until it gets a 402 response, then displays price, accepted payment schemes, network, and input/output schemas.

## Examples

```bash
# Search for weather-related paid APIs
npx awal@2.8.0 x402 bazaar search "weather"

# Search with more results
npx awal@2.8.0 x402 bazaar search "sentiment analysis" -k 10

# Browse all bazaar resources with full details
npx awal@2.8.0 x402 bazaar list --full

# Check what an endpoint costs
npx awal@2.8.0 x402 details https://example.com/api/weather
```

## Prerequisites

- No authentication needed for search, list, or details commands

## Next Steps

Once you've found a service you want to use, use the `pay-for-service` skill to make a paid request to the endpoint.

## Error Handling

- "CDP API returned 429" - Rate limited; cached data will be used if available
- "No X402 payment requirements found" - URL may not be an x402 endpoint
