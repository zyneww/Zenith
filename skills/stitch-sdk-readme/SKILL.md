# Stitch SDK README Generator

This skill produces the README for `@google/stitch-sdk`. It combines a structural strategy (the Bookstore Test) with instructions for sourcing the current API from the codebase — so the README stays accurate as the SDK evolves.

---

## How to Source the Current API

Do not hard-code the API surface. Read it from the codebase at invocation time:

| What you need | Where to find it |
|---|---|
| Public exports (full surface) | `packages/sdk/src/index.ts` |
| Domain class methods + signatures | Source files for each exported class (`sdk.ts`, `project.ts`, `screen.ts`) |
| Generated method bindings | `packages/sdk/generated/domain-map.json` → `bindings[]` array |
| Handwritten methods | Methods in class source files that aren't in domain-map bindings (e.g. `Screen.edit`, `Screen.variants`) |
| AI SDK tools adapter | `packages/sdk/src/ai.ts` → subpath entry for `stitchTools()` |
| Generated tool definitions | `packages/sdk/generated/src/tool-definitions.ts` → JSON Schema for each tool |
| Tool client methods | `packages/sdk/src/client.ts` |
| Error codes | `packages/sdk/src/spec/errors.ts` → `StitchErrorCode` |
| Config options | `packages/sdk/src/spec/client.ts` → `StitchConfigSchema` |
| Proxy config | `packages/sdk/src/proxy/core.ts` |

After reading these files, you have the complete API surface. Structure it using the Bookstore Test template below.

## The Bookstore Test

A reader decides whether to use a library the same way a person decides to buy a book: they glance at the **cover**, read the **inner flap**, then commit to **reading the book**. The README must earn the reader's attention at each stage.

### The Cover

A single sentence stating what problem this library solves — not what the library *is*. The reader should recognize their own situation. No taglines, no badges, no logos.

**For this SDK**, the cover is about generating UI from text and extracting HTML/screenshots programmatically.

**Good:** "Generate UI screens from text prompts and extract their HTML and screenshots programmatically."
**Bad:** "The official TypeScript SDK for Google Stitch, a powerful AI-powered UI generation platform."

### The Inner Flap

Immediately show the library in use. Code first, not setup.

**Primary workflow** — the punchline everything in the SDK exists to produce:
```
project(id) → generate → getHtml
```
Show this as the first code block, with one line noting the env var requirement. Do not show installation, imports, or config before this. Show `callTool("create_project", ...)` separately for project creation.

**Secondary workflows** — reveal depth progressively:
1. Listing and iterating over existing projects/screens
2. Editing a screen and generating variants
3. Tool access via singleton (`stitch.listTools()`, `stitch.callTool()`) — zero setup
4. Explicit configuration via `StitchToolClient` (custom API key, base URL)
5. AI SDK integration via `stitchTools()` — import from `@google/stitch-sdk/ai`, show `generateText` with `tools: stitchTools()` and `stepCountIs`

Rules for this section:
- **No setup first.** One line mentioning `STITCH_API_KEY` is enough before the first example.
- **Dual install paths.** Show `npm install @google/stitch-sdk` first (core SDK, standalone). Then show `npm install @google/stitch-sdk ai` for AI SDK users. The `ai` package is only needed when importing from `@google/stitch-sdk/ai`.
- **Straightforward language.** No "powerful", "seamless", "robust", "enterprise-grade".
- **Working examples.** Every code block must be valid, runnable code — not fragments with `// ...` elisions.
- **Progressive complexity.** Simplest invocation first, then deeper capabilities.

### Reading the Book

The reader is committed. Document the full API as a reference.

Structure by class in this order: `Stitch` → `Project` → `DesignSystem` → `Screen` → `StitchToolClient` → `toolDefinitions` / `toolMap` → `stitchTools()` (AI SDK) → `StitchProxy` → `stitch` singleton.

Each entry should have:
- What it does (one line)
- Usage example (minimal, runnable)
- Parameters (table)
- Return type and error behavior

Setup, authentication, and configuration go here — after the reader has already decided the library is worth using.

### Tone

Write like a colleague explaining their work to another engineer. Be direct. Be specific. Don't sell — inform. If a feature has limitations, state them. If setup is complex, say so.

## Validation

After generating the README, verify:

- [ ] Can a reader understand what the library does in under 10 seconds?
- [ ] Is there a runnable code example within the first scroll?
- [ ] Does setup/config appear *after* the first code example?
- [ ] Is every code block valid, copy-pasteable code?
- [ ] Is the language descriptive rather than promotional?
- [ ] Does the reference section cover every public export from `index.ts`?
- [ ] Every method name in examples exists in its class source file
- [ ] Every import in examples matches an export in `index.ts`
- [ ] All three modalities are documented: domain classes (scripts), `StitchToolClient` (agents), `stitchTools()` (AI SDK)

## Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Why it fails |
|---|---|
| Leading with badges, logos, or status shields | Visual noise before the reader knows what the library does |
| "Getting Started" as the first section | Forces setup before demonstrating value |
| Feature bullet lists without code | Tells instead of shows |
| "Easy to use", "simple", "just works" | Self-congratulatory claims that invite skepticism |
| Long install/config blocks before any usage | Asks for investment before demonstrating return |
| Collapsible sections hiding core API docs | Buries the content committed readers came for |
| Hard-coding the API in docs without sourcing | Goes stale when tools are added |
