## Platform Selection Notes

1. Prefer provider-native managed services when team expertise and lock-in tolerance are high.
2. Prefer Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, Redis, and open observability stacks when portability matters.
3. Use OCI when Oracle database affinity, predictable networking, or regulated workload isolation are primary drivers.
4. Compare egress, managed service premiums, and support plans before splitting workloads across providers.
