# Step 4: Write the Storyboard

**Before writing anything, fully re-read these files:**

- **DESIGN.md** — your color palette, font rules, components, Do's/Don'ts. Every creative decision must be grounded in this brand identity. If it says "white backgrounds with purple accent" — plan light scenes, not dark moody ones.
- **`extracted/asset-descriptions.md`** — read EVERY line. This is your menu of available visuals. Each line describes what the image actually shows (e.g., "translucent ribbons in orange, pink, and purple on white background" or "a high-speed train under a dark starry sky"). Use these descriptions to decide which assets belong in which beat. Assets you don't understand from the description — view them directly before assigning.
- **[techniques.md](techniques.md)** — 10 visual techniques (SVG path drawing, Canvas 2D art, CSS 3D, per-word typography, Lottie, video compositing, typing effect, variable fonts, MotionPath, velocity transitions). Pick 2-3 per beat and specify them in the storyboard.

The storyboard is the creative north star. It tells the engineer exactly what to build for each beat — mood, camera, animations, transitions, assets, sound. Write it as if you're briefing a motion designer who's never seen the website.

Save as `STORYBOARD.md` in the project directory.

## Global Direction

Every STORYBOARD.md starts with global settings:

```markdown
**Format:** 1920×1080
**Audio:** [TTS provider] voiceover + underscore + SFX
**VO direction:** [voice character — e.g., "mid-age male, calm confident delivery,
Apple keynote register — economy of words, silence between sentences is a feature"]
**Style basis:** DESIGN.md (brand colors, fonts, components from the captured site)
```

**Global guardrails** (adapt to the brand):

- Push color presence. Muted is fine, flat is not. Every beat should have at least one color that pulls your eye.
- Motion should be visible and intentional. Err toward more movement than feels safe — subtle reads as static at 30fps.
- Use as many captured assets as the creative vision allows. Scatter framework icons around a dashboard. Layer enterprise photos behind stats. Use product screenshots as floating cards. The assets exist — use them generously.
- Aim for 8-10 visual elements per beat, not 2-3. A great beat has: background texture, midground content, foreground accents, floating decorative elements, animated icons, SVG path drawings, particle effects, typographic details. It should feel DENSE and alive.
- Use at least 2-3 different techniques from techniques.md per beat — not across the whole video, per beat. Don't default to basic fade/scale/opacity — mix in SVG path drawing, CSS 3D transforms, typing effects, counter animations, canvas procedural art. Each beat should feel like its own visual world.

**Underscore/music direction** (if applicable):

- Describe the mood, reference artists, when it swells or drops
- Example: "Minimal electronic. Warm sustained pad already playing when the video starts. Sits underneath everything, never competing with VO. Swells gently during the flex section, drops to near-nothing for the comparison, resolves on a final chord."

## Asset Audit

Before writing any beats, audit every captured asset. Print this table:

| Asset                          | Type       | Assign to Beat | Role                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| wave-fallback-desktop.png      | Hero image | Beat 1         | Full-bleed animated background        |
| enterprise-accordion-hertz.png | Photo      | Beat 3         | Enterprise credibility, Ken Burns pan |
| stripe-logo.svg                | SVG        | Beat 1, Beat 5 | Brand mark opener + closer            |
| datavizstatic3x.png            | Data viz   | Beat 3         | Supporting visual behind stats        |
| icon-3.svg                     | Icon       | SKIP           | Decorative, too small                 |

**Minimum utilization:**

- At least 50% of product screenshots and hero images must appear
- Brand logo appears in the first AND last beat
- The site's signature visual (gradient wave, hero illustration, key product UI) must appear — it's the most recognizable brand element
- Maximum 2 consecutive text-only beats. The 3rd must contain a visual asset
- Opening beat must contain a visual asset, not text-only

## Per-Beat Direction

Each beat is a WORLD, not a layout. Before writing CSS specs and GSAP instructions, describe what the viewer EXPERIENCES. The difference between a great storyboard and a mediocre one:

**Mediocre:** "Dark navy background. '$1.9T' in white, 280px. Logo top-left. Wave image bottom-right."
**Great:** "Camera is already mid-flight over a vast dark canvas. The gradient wave sweeps across the frame like aurora borealis — alive, shifting. '$1.9T' SLAMS into existence with such force the wave ripples in response. This isn't a slide — it's a moment."

The first describes pixels. The second describes an experience. Write the second, then figure out the pixels.

Each beat should have:

### Concept

The big idea for this beat in 2-3 sentences. What visual WORLD are we in? What metaphor drives it? What should the viewer FEEL? This is the most important part — everything else flows from it.

### VO cue

Which narration line plays over this beat.

### Visual description

What the viewer sees — described cinematically, not as CSS specs. Use camera language (pan, zoom, drift, settle). Describe at least 5 visual elements, not just text + background. Think in layers — what's moving in the foreground, midground, background simultaneously?

### Mood direction

Cultural and design references, not hex codes:

- "Geometric, rhythmic, precise. Think Josef Albers or Bauhaus color studies."
- "Warm workspace. Nice notebook energy, not technical blueprint."
- "Cinematic title sequence. The kind of opening where you lean forward."

### Assets

Which captured files to use, referenced by filename:

- "Background: `assets/wave-fallback-desktop.png` — full-bleed, slow zoom 1→1.04 over beat duration"
- "Logo: `assets/svgs/stripe-logo.svg` — centered, fades in at 0.5s"
- "Enterprise photo: `assets/enterprise-accordion-hertz.png` — Ken Burns pan, 70% opacity overlay"

### Animation choreography

Specific motion verbs per element — not "it animates in" but HOW:

| Energy        | Verbs                                         | Example                               |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| High impact   | SLAMS, CRASHES, PUNCHES, STAMPS, SHATTERS     | "$1.9T" SLAMS in from left at -5°     |
| Medium energy | CASCADE, SLIDES, DROPS, FILLS, DRAWS          | Three cards CASCADE in staggered 0.3s |
| Low energy    | types on, FLOATS, morphs, COUNTS UP, fades in | Counter COUNTS UP from 0 to 135K      |

Every element gets a verb. If you can't name the verb, the element is not yet designed.

### Transition

How this beat hands off to the next. Specify the type and parameters.

**CSS transitions** (choose from `skills/hyperframes/references/transitions/catalog.md`):

- Velocity-matched upward: exit `y:-150, blur:30px, 0.33s power2.in` → entry `y:150→0, blur:30px→0, 1.0s power2.out`
- Whip pan: exit `x:-400, blur:24px, 0.3s power3.in` → entry `x:400→0, blur:24px→0, 0.3s power3.out`
- Blur through: exit `blur:20px, 0.3s` → entry `blur:20px→0, 0.25s power3.out`
- Zoom through: exit `scale:1→1.2, blur:20px, 0.2s power3.in` → entry `scale:0.75→1, blur:20px→0, 0.5s expo.out`
- Hard cut / smash cut (for rapid-fire sequences)

**Shader transitions** (choose from `skills/hyperframes/references/transitions/shader-transitions.md`):

- Cross-Warp Morph (organic, versatile) — 0.5-0.8s, power2.inOut
- Cinematic Zoom (professional momentum) — 0.4-0.6s, power2.inOut
- Gravitational Lens (otherworldly) — 0.6-1.0s, power2.inOut
- Glitch (aggressive, high energy) — 0.3-0.5s
- See `skills/hyperframes/references/transitions/shader-setup.md` for the full WebGL boilerplate

**How velocity-matched CSS transitions work:**
Exit the outgoing beat with an accelerating ease (power2.in or power3.in) plus a blur ramp. Enter the incoming beat with a decelerating ease (power2.out or power3.out) plus blur clear. The fastest point of both easing curves meets at the cut — the viewer perceives continuous camera motion, not two discrete animations. Match exit velocity to entry velocity within ~5% tolerance.

### Depth layers

What's in foreground, midground, and background. Every beat should have at least 2 layers:

- "BG: dark navy fill + subtle radial glow. MG: stat cards with drop shadow. FG: brand logo bottom-right."

### SFX cues

What sounds at what moment:

- "On the capture pulse — a soft, warm analog shutter click."
- "Left side carries a faint low drone. On fold: drone cuts. Silence. Then a single clean chime."

## Example: Beat-by-Beat Format

Here are three beats from a production storyboard showing the level of detail expected.

### BEAT 1 — COLD OPEN (0:00–0:05)

**VO:** "Your AI agent already knows how to make videos."

**Concept:** We're already in motion when the video starts. No title card, no fade from black. We're mid-flight over an infinite creative workspace — dozens of living compositions scattered below us like a city seen from a drone. Each one is alive, running a different animation. The message is clear before any words: this tool makes videos. Lots of them.

**Visual:** Slow smooth diagonal drift over a vast canvas (3600×2200px plane). Scattered across it: 25 composition cards at organic angles (±5-15° rotation), soft shadows, thin borders. Each card contains a DIFFERENT running animation — kinetic type, gradient morph, data viz, particle system, logo assembly, SVG drawing, shader noise, 3D rotating object. Depth-of-field: close cards slightly blurred, focal sweet-spot in mid-distance, far cards smaller and desaturated.

**Camera:** Diagonal drift top-left to bottom-right, slight 2-3° rotation over 5s. power1.inOut ease. Zoom accelerates in final second as we approach one specific card.

**Assets:** Product screenshots and logo on cards. Each card is a mini-composition with its own animation.

**SFX:** Ambient warmth pad already playing. Faint textured hum — overhearing creative activity from a distance.

### BEAT 5 — THE THESIS (0:20–0:24)

**VO:** "Anything a browser can render can be a frame in your video."

**Mood:** Big statement. This sentence gets its own canvas. Clean, spacious, typographic.

**Visual:** Words appear as staggered kinetic typography. "Anything a browser can render" — distinctive serif, gentle fade + rise (y: 24px → 0, opacity 0 → 1, 0.4s, power2.out). Held beat — one second of stillness. "can be a frame in your video." appears below. As the final word lands, the entire text pulses once — a brief warm flash, subtle scale bump to 101%.

**Transition OUT:** Whip pan left — x:-400, blur:24px, opacity:0.4, 0.3s power3.in

**SFX:** Silence under the first line. On the capture pulse — a soft analog shutter click.

---

### BEAT 7 — THE CONTRAST (0:38–0:44)

**VO:** "No new framework for the agent to learn. Just HTML."

**Mood:** Clean comparison. Light base. Two worlds side by side.

**Visual:** Left half: dense code, small, compressed, overwhelming. Scrolls slowly upward. Slightly desaturated. Right half: spacious HTML, syntax-highlighted, generous line spacing, inviting. On "Just HTML." — the left side folds inward along its center line, like a book closing. The right side expands to fill the frame. Warm glow rises behind it.

**Transition IN:** Zoom through — scale 0.75→1, blur 20px→0, 0.5s expo.out
**Transition OUT:** Velocity-matched upward — y:-150, blur:30px, 0.33s power2.in

**Assets:** Real framework code on the left (actual content, not lorem ipsum). Real HyperFrames HTML on the right.

**SFX:** Left side carries a faint low drone. On fold: drone cuts. Silence. Then a single clean chime as the right side expands.
