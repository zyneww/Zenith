# Firecrawl Build Map

Use this when the product knows the site but not the exact URLs.

## Use This When

- the feature starts with a domain or site section
- you need URL discovery before extraction
- the product should inspect site structure without doing a full crawl yet

## Guidance

- Use `/map` before `/crawl` when URL discovery itself is the main job.
- Combine `/map` with `/scrape` when you only need a filtered subset of pages.
- Keep this as lighter coverage than `/scrape`, `/search`, and `/interact` unless the feature is navigation-heavy.

## When Not To Use It

- If you already have the exact URL, use [firecrawl-build-scrape](../firecrawl-build-scrape/SKILL.md).
- If the feature begins with a general query across the web, use [firecrawl-build-search](../firecrawl-build-search/SKILL.md).

## Docs (Source of Truth)

Read the docs for request/response schemas, parameters, and SDK examples before writing integration code:
