# Firecrawl Build Crawl

Use this when the product needs many pages from the same site, not just one.

## Use This When

- the feature targets a docs section, blog, or help center
- you need bulk extraction with path or depth boundaries
- the product should ingest or refresh a site section at once

## Guidance

- Keep crawl scope narrow with path, depth, or page-count constraints.
- Prefer `/crawl` over many manual `/scrape` calls when the site structure is stable.
- Treat this as secondary to `/scrape`, `/search`, and `/interact` unless the feature is clearly site-wide.

## When Not To Use It

- If you only need one known URL, use [firecrawl-build-scrape](../firecrawl-build-scrape/SKILL.md).
- If you first need to discover URLs on a single site, start with [firecrawl-build-map](../firecrawl-build-map/SKILL.md).

## Docs (Source of Truth)

Read the docs for request/response schemas, parameters, and SDK examples before writing integration code:
