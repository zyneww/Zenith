# Step 5: Concatenate Final Protocol

## Purpose

This subskill concatenates all protocol section files (from Steps 2, 3, and 4) into a single, complete protocol markdown file. This is the final assembly step that produces the complete clinical trial protocol.

## Prerequisites

**Required Files:**
- `waypoints/intervention_metadata.json`
- `waypoints/02_protocol_metadata.json` (must show step_4_status: "completed")
- `waypoints/02_protocol_foundation.md` (Sections 1-6 from Step 2)
- `waypoints/03_protocol_intervention.md` (Sections 7-8 from Step 3)
- `waypoints/04_protocol_operations.md` (Sections 9-12 from Step 4)

## What This Subskill Does

1. Verifies all section files exist
2. Concatenates sections 1-12 into final protocol ]
3. Updates metadata to mark protocol as complete
4. Displays final summary

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Verify Prerequisites

Read `waypoints/02_protocol_metadata.json` and verify:
- `step_4_status` is "completed"
- All section files exist:
  - `waypoints/02_protocol_foundation.md`
  - `waypoints/03_protocol_intervention.md`
  - `waypoints/04_protocol_operations.md`

**If Step 4 not completed:**
```
Error: Step 4 must be completed before concatenation.
Phase 4 status: [current status]

Please complete Step 4 to generate final protocol sections (9-12).
```
Exit.

**If any section files missing:**
```
Error: Required protocol section files not found.
Expected:
  - waypoints/02_protocol_foundation.md (Step 2 output)
  - waypoints/03_protocol_intervention.md (Step 3 output)
  - waypoints/04_protocol_operations.md (Step 4 output)

Please ensure Steps 2, 3, and 4 are completed.
```
Exit.

**If prerequisites verified:** Proceed to Step 2.

### Step 2: Concatenate Protocol Sections

Combine all three protocol section files into the final complete protocol.

**Procedure:**
1. Use `cat` command to concatenate files in order:
   ```bash
   cat waypoints/02_protocol_foundation.md waypoints/03_protocol_intervention.md waypoints/04_protocol_operations.md > waypoints/protocol_complete.md
   ```
2. Verify `waypoints/protocol_complete.md` was created successfully
3. Check file size and line count to ensure all content was included
4. Display file statistics

**Expected output:**
- Filename: `waypoints/protocol_complete.md`
- Size: ~500KB-2MB
- Lines: ~5,000-15,000 lines
- Sections: All 12 sections (1-12)

### Step 3: Verify Complete Protocol

Read the concatenated file to verify:
- File is readable
- Contains all 12 section headers
- No missing content or truncation
- Proper markdown formatting preserved

**Section headers to verify:**
```
# 1. STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE
# 2. PROTOCOL SUMMARY
# 3. INTRODUCTION AND STUDY RATIONALE
# 4. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS
# 5. STUDY DESIGN
# 6. STUDY POPULATION
# 7. STUDY INTERVENTION
# 8. STUDY INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION AND PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL
# 9. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
# 10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
# 11. SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
# 12. REFERENCES
```

### Step 4: Update Metadata

## Quality Checks

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] `protocol_complete.md` created successfully
- [ ] File size is reasonable (500KB-2MB typical)
- [ ] All 12 section headers present
- [ ] No content truncation or missing sections
- [ ] Line count is appropriate (~5,000-15,000 lines)
- [ ] Metadata updated correctly
- [ ] Final summary displays all information

## Notes

- This is a simple concatenation step - no content generation occurs
- All protocol content was generated in Steps 2, 3, and 4
- The concatenated file is the final deliverable in markdown format
- The protocol is production-ready markdown suitable for version control
