# Step 3: Clinical Protocol Intervention Details

## Purpose

This subskill generates the intervention-specific sections (6-7) of a clinical study protocol. It adds detailed intervention administration, dose modifications (if applicable), preparation/handling, randomization/blinding, compliance monitoring, and discontinuation procedures to the protocol foundation.

## Prerequisites

**Required Files:**
- `waypoints/intervention_metadata.json` (must contain `protocol_template` field from Step 2)
- `waypoints/01_clinical_research_summary.json`
- `waypoints/02_protocol_foundation.md` (sections 1-5 from Step 2)
- `waypoints/02_protocol_metadata.json` (must show step_2_status: "completed")

## What This Subskill Does

1. Verifies Step 2 completion
2. Reads protocol template (from metadata) and shared guidance
3. Synthesizes intervention-specific content for Sections 6-7
4. Creates new file `waypoints/03_protocol_intervention.md` with Sections 6-7
5. Updates protocol metadata tracking file

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Verify Step 2 Completion

Read `waypoints/02_protocol_metadata.json` and verify:
- `step_2_status` is "completed"
- `waypoints/02_protocol_foundation.md` exists (Step 2 output)

**If Step 2 not completed:**
```
Error: Step 2 must be completed before Step 3.
Step 2 status: [current status]

Please complete Step 2 first to generate protocol foundation (Sections 1-6).
```
Exit.

**If Step 2 completed:** Proceed to Step 2.

### Step 2: Read Protocol Template and Shared Guidance

1. Read `waypoints/intervention_metadata.json` to get the `protocol_template` and `template_source` field values
2. **Read the protocol template file:**
   - The path is stored in `protocol_template` field (could be `assets/[name].md` OR a user-provided path)
   - Read the file at that path (focus on Sections 6-7)
   - Note: The `template_source` field indicates whether this is `"directory"` or `"user_provided"` (for logging/debugging only)
3. Read `waypoints/02_protocol_foundation.md` to understand existing context (especially study design, endpoints, and population from Sections 1-5)

**Internalize:**
- Template structure for Sections 6-7
- Content depth targets from shared guidance
- Intervention-specific terminology (device vs drug)
- Dose modification table requirements (for complex drugs)
- Quality principles (comprehensive over brief, specific over generic)

### Step 3: Synthesize Intervention Details Content

Generate Sections 6-7 following template structure, adapted for this specific intervention and indication.

**Use data from:**
- Intervention metadata (intervention type, name, classification, regulatory status)
- Step 1 clinical research summary (similar trials, dosing information, safety profiles)
- Existing protocol draft (study design, endpoints, schedule of activities)

**Follow guidance from:**
- Selected protocol template from Step 2 (structure, regulatory requirements)

- Contact methods: Phone calls (multiple times, different times of day), certified mail, email (if permitted by IRB), text message (if permitted), contact of emergency contact person (per consent), query site staff/coordinators, check medical records for recent visits
- Documentation: Document each contact attempt (date, time, method, outcome) in study records
- Timing: Attempts made over at least 2-4 weeks

**Reporting:**
- Report to sponsor: Notify sponsor of LTFU
- Report to IRB: Per IRB requirements

**Analysis:**

**Do Not:**
- Do not consider participant withdrawn without documented contact attempts
- Do not replace LTFU participants (unless protocol specifies)

### Step 4: Create Intervention Details File

**IMPORTANT:** This creates a NEW file with only Sections 6-7.

Create `waypoints/03_protocol_intervention.md` with Sections 6-7 only.

**Procedure:**
1. Generate Section 6 content
2. Generate Section 7 content
3. Write both sections to new file `waypoints/03_protocol_intervention.md`
4. Confirm file creation successful

### Step 5: Update Protocol Metadata

Update `waypoints/02_protocol_metadata.json`:
- Set `step_3_status` to "completed"
- Add sections 7 and 8 to `sections_completed` array
- Update `protocol_status` to "intervention_complete"
- Update notes

### Step 6: Display Summary

Display concise summary with:
- Intervention name, protocol version, date
- Step 3 completion status
- Sections completed: 7-8 (Study Intervention, Discontinuation)
- Protocol file updated with size
- DRAFT disclaimer
- Next steps: Review intervention details, continue to Phase 4 for assessments and statistics (Sections 9-12)

**Example output:**
```
✅ Step 3: Intervention Details - COMPLETED

Intervention: [Name]
Protocol: Version 1.0 Draft (2025-12-03)

Sections Completed (7-8):
  ✓ Section 7: Study Intervention
    - Administration procedures and dosing
    - Dose modifications [if applicable]
    - Preparation, handling, storage
    - Randomization and blinding
    - Compliance monitoring
    - Concomitant therapy
  ✓ Section 7: Study Intervention Discontinuation and Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal

Files Updated:
  • waypoints/03_protocol_intervention.md (appended ~[size]KB, now [total lines] lines)
  • waypoints/02_protocol_metadata.json

Protocol Status: Sections 1-8 complete (Foundation + Intervention)

```

## Output Files

**Created:**
- `waypoints/03_protocol_intervention.md` (Sections 6-7 only, ~1,200 lines)

**Updated:**
- `waypoints/02_protocol_metadata.json` (step 3 marked complete)

**NOT updated yet:**
- `waypoints/intervention_metadata.json` (will be updated after Step 4 completes)
- `waypoints/02_protocol_draft.md` (will be created by Step 4 concatenation)

## Error Handling

**If Phase 2 not completed:**
```
Error: Step 2 must be completed first.
Current status: step_2_status = [status]

Please complete Step 2 to generate protocol foundation (Sections 1-6) before proceeding to Phase 3.
```

**If protocol foundation file missing:**
```
Error: Protocol foundation file not found.
Expected: waypoints/02_protocol_foundation.md

Please run Step 2 first to create the protocol foundation.
```

**If user declines intervention details:**
```
Intervention details skipped at user request.
Step 3 not completed.
User can return to this phase later if needed.
```

**If Step 3 already completed:**
```
Warning: Phase 3 appears to be already completed.
Metadata shows: step_3_status = "completed"

Would you like to:
  1. Skip Step 3 and continue to Phase 4
  2. Regenerate Step 3 (will overwrite Sections 6-7)
  3. Exit
```

## Quality Checks

Before finalizing, verify:
- [ ] Section 6 generated with all required subsections (6.1-6.6)
- [ ] Intervention-specific content (device vs drug terminology used correctly)
- [ ] Dose modifications section appropriate for intervention type
- [ ] Section 7 includes all three subsections (7.1-7.3)
- [ ] Content appended successfully to existing protocol draft
- [ ] Protocol metadata updated correctly
- [ ] Intervention details length: ~1,200 lines (appropriate for complexity)
- [ ] Total protocol now contains Sections 1-7

## Notes

- This subskill generates approximately 1,200 lines of protocol content
- Output stays within token limits by focusing on Sections 6-7 only
- Step 4 will complete the protocol by adding assessments, statistics, and operational content
