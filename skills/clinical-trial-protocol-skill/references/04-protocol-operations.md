## Purpose

This subskill generates the operational, assessment, and statistical sections (8-11) of a clinical study protocol. It adds efficacy and safety assessments, adverse event reporting, statistical analysis plan with sample size calculation, regulatory/operational considerations, and references to complete the protocol.

## Prerequisites

**Required Files:**
- `waypoints/intervention_metadata.json` (must contain `protocol_template` field from Step 2)
- `waypoints/01_clinical_research_summary.json`
- `waypoints/02_protocol_foundation.md` (sections 1-5 from Step 2)
- `waypoints/03_protocol_intervention.md` (sections 6-7 from Step 3)
- `waypoints/02_protocol_metadata.json` (must show step_3_status: "completed")
- `scripts/sample_size_calculator.py` (for sample size calculation)

## What This Subskill Does

1. Verifies Step 3 completion
2. **Performs sample size calculation** (asks user for parameters, runs calculator script)
3. Reads protocol template (from metadata) and shared guidance
4. Synthesizes operational and statistical content for Sections 8-11
5. Creates new file `waypoints/04_protocol_operations.md` with Sections 8-11
6. **Concatenates all protocol sections** into `waypoints/02_protocol_draft.md`
7. Updates protocol and intervention metadata

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Verify Phase 3 Completion

Read `waypoints/02_protocol_metadata.json` and verify:
- `step_3_status` is "completed"
- `waypoints/02_protocol_foundation.md` exists (Sections 1-5)
- `waypoints/03_protocol_intervention.md` exists (Sections 6-7)

**If Step 3 not completed:**
```
Error: Step 3 must be completed before Phase 4.
Phase 3 status: [current status]

Please complete Step 3 first to generate intervention details (Sections 6-7).
```
Exit.

**If Phase 3 completed:** Proceed to Step 2.

### Step 2: Calculate Sample Size

- Rationale: Account for participants lost to follow-up, withdrawals, and missing data
- Adjusted sample size per arm: [n_per_arm] / (1 - [dropout]) = [adjusted_n_per_arm]
- Total enrollment target: [adjusted_n_total]

**Formula shown:**
```
Adjusted N = N / (1 - dropout rate)
Adjusted N per arm = [n_per_arm] / (1 - [dropout]) = [adjusted_n_per_arm]
Total enrollment: [adjusted_n_total]
```

**Paragraph 4: Sensitivity Analyses** (40 lines):
- To assess robustness of sample size, calculations performed under alternative assumptions:

**Alternative Scenario 1: Lower effect size (20% reduction):**
- Effect size: [X * 0.8] [or P2-P1 reduced by 20%]
- Calculated N per arm: [Calculate alternative N]
- Interpretation: [State whether study still adequately powered]

**Alternative Scenario 2: Higher effect size (20% increase):**
- Effect size: [X * 1.2] [or P2-P1 increased by 20%]
- Calculated N per arm: [Calculate alternative N]
- Interpretation: [State increased power]

**Alternative Scenario 3: Higher variance (20% increase in SD):**
- Standard deviation: [Y * 1.2]
- Calculated N per arm: [Calculate alternative N]
- Interpretation: [State impact on power]

**Conclusion:** The proposed sample size is robust to moderate deviations from assumptions. If actual effect size or variance differs substantially from assumptions, study may be underpowered or overpowered.

**Paragraph 5: Power for Secondary Endpoints** (20 lines):
- Sample size is powered for the primary efficacy endpoint only
- Secondary endpoints:
  - Expected to have [greater/similar/lower] effect sizes
  - Study may have [sufficient/insufficient] power to detect clinically meaningful differences in secondary endpoints
  - If power is limited, secondary endpoint analyses may be considered exploratory and hypothesis-generating
- Acknowledge that study is not formally powered for multiple comparisons across all secondary endpoints

- Sample size assumptions informed by similar trials:
  - [NCT number and citation 1]
  - [NCT number and citation 2]
  - [NCT number and citation 3]
- Sample size calculation performed using [software, e.g., "nQuery version X", "PASS version X", "R statistical software", "SAS PROC POWER"]
- **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:** "Sample size calculations are preliminary and subject to biostatistician review and validation prior to study initiation. Final sample size may be adjusted based on updated assumptions or regulatory feedback."

**Multiple Imputation:** MICE or similar; 20-50 imputations; combined via Rubin's rules; MAR assumption
**LOCF:** Generally NOT recommended unless field standard; assumes no change after dropout

**Rationale:** [Justify method based on expected patterns and literature]

**Sensitivity Analyses:**

1. **Complete Case:** Observed outcomes only (MCAR assumption)
2. **Worst-Case:** Intervention = worst, Control = best (conservative)

## Quality Checks

Before finalizing, verify:
- [ ] Sample size calculation completed successfully (or fallback with disclaimer)
- [ ] Section 8 generated with ALL 9 AE/SAE subsections (8.3.1-8.3.9)
- [ ] Section 9 generated with ALL 10 statistical subsections (9.4.1-9.4.10)
- [ ] Sample size section uses actual values from calculation JSON file
- [ ] Section 10 includes all operational subsections
- [ ] Section 11 includes 30-60 references organized by category
- [ ] Content appended successfully to existing protocol draft
- [ ] Protocol metadata updated correctly
- [ ] Intervention metadata updated correctly

## Notes

- **Sample size calculation is interactive** - requires user input
- Output stays within token limits by focusing on Sections 8-11 only
- **This phase generates the final sections** - all 11 sections now generated but not yet concatenated
- User must proceed to Step 5 for final protocol concatenation
