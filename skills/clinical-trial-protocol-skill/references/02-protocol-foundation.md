# Step 2: Clinical Protocol Foundation

## Purpose

This subskill generates a **title page** and the foundation sections (1-6) of a clinical study protocol. It creates the protocol framework including a formal title page, compliance statements, study summary, introduction, objectives, design, and population criteria.

## Prerequisites

**Required Files:**
- `waypoints/intervention_metadata.json`
- `waypoints/01_clinical_research_summary.json`
- At least one protocol template (`.md` file) in the `assets/` directory

## What This Subskill Does

1. Reads intervention metadata and clinical research summary
2. Reads NIH template and shared guidance
3. Generates formal protocol title page with regulatory identifiers
4. Synthesizes intervention-specific protocol content for Sections 1-6
5. Writes protocol foundation (title page + Sections 1-6) to waypoint file (creates new file)
6. Creates protocol metadata tracking file

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Load Previous Waypoints

Read all required files:
- `waypoints/intervention_metadata.json` (including initial_context if provided)
- `waypoints/01_clinical_research_summary.json`

### Step 2: Discover and Select Protocol Template

**PRIORITY 1: Check for user-provided template from Step 0**

1. Read `waypoints/intervention_metadata.json` and check the `user_provided_template` field
2. **If `user_provided_template.provided` is `true`:**
   - User has already provided a custom template
   - Verify the file exists and is readable at `user_provided_template.file_path`
   - If file is valid, use it as the template
   - Store in metadata: `"protocol_template": "[user_provided_template.file_path]"`
   - Store template source: `"template_source": "user_provided"`
   - Display: "✓ Using custom template: [file_name]"
   - **Skip to Step 3**

**PRIORITY 2: Check assets/ directory**

3. List all `.md` files in the `assets/` directory
4. **If exactly one template found:** Use it automatically
   - Store: `"protocol_template": "assets/[name].md"`, `"template_source": "directory"`
5. **If multiple templates found:** Present list to user
   - Ask: "Multiple templates found. Please select: [list templates with numbers]"
   - Store selected: `"protocol_template": "assets/[selected].md"`, `"template_source": "directory"`
6. **If no templates found AND no user-provided template:** Display error and exit

**Store the template selection in `waypoints/intervention_metadata.json`:**
```json
{
  "protocol_template": "assets/[name].md" or "[user-provided-path]",
  "template_source": "directory" or "user_provided"
}
```

### Step 3: Read Protocol Template and Shared Guidance

1. Read the selected protocol template file from Step 2 in its entirety

**Internalize:**
- NIH template structure for Sections 1-6
- Content depth targets from shared guidance
- Quality principles (comprehensive over brief, specific over generic)
- Intervention-specific terminology (device vs drug)
- Table formatting guidelines
- **CRITICAL: Extract the exact Table of Contents structure from the template (lines 188-368) and include it verbatim in the generated protocol after the Title Page**

### Step 4: Generate Protocol Title Page

Generate formal title page (see Title Page section below) with:
- Metadata table with protocol title, NCT number placeholder, document date
- Protocol identifier and product name
- Confidentiality statement
- Sponsor information
- Full protocol title
- Regulatory identifiers (IND/IDE number)
- Footer with version and confidentiality marking

### Step 5: Synthesize Protocol Foundation Content

Generate Sections 1-6 following template structure, adapted for this specific intervention and indication.

**Use data from:**
- Intervention metadata (intervention type, name, indication, initial context)
- Step 1 clinical research summary (similar trials, FDA guidance, disease background, recommended design)

**Follow guidance from:**
- Selected protocol template from Step 2 (structure, regulatory requirements)

## Section Generation Instructions

### Title Page (Protocol Cover Page) (30 lines)

**Generate a formal protocol title page** similar to industry-standard protocols (e.g., pharmaceutical company protocols). This page appears BEFORE Section 1.

**Content to Generate:**

1. **Metadata Table** (5 lines):
   Create a simple markdown table with key protocol identifiers:

   |**Document Date:**|[Current date in DD-MMM-YYYY format]|
   ```

2. **Protocol Identifier** (3 lines):
   - Protocol number/code (if sponsor has format, otherwise use: `PROTO-[InterventionAcronym]-[Indication]-001`)
   - Product name or device name
   - Protocol/Amendment number (e.g., "Protocol No.: 001-00" for initial version)

3. **Confidentiality Statement** (5 lines):
   - State confidentiality of protocol document
   - Example: "THIS PROTOCOL AND ALL OF THE INFORMATION RELATING TO IT ARE CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY PROPERTY OF [SPONSOR NAME]."
   - Adapt based on whether academic, NIH, or industry-sponsored

4. **Sponsor Information** (10 lines):
   - **SPONSOR:** [Institution or Company Name]
   - (hereafter referred to as the Sponsor or [Abbreviation])

**4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design** (50 lines):
- Why was this design chosen?
  - **If RCT:** Why is randomized controlled trial necessary? (gold standard for efficacy, regulatory requirement, ethical justification)
  - **If single-arm:** Why is single-arm acceptable? (rare disease, no standard comparator, ethical considerations, regulatory precedent - cite similar trials)
- Why this comparator/control?
  - **If placebo:** Justify placebo use (no effective treatment exists, or placebo + standard care design)
  - **If active comparator:** Why this specific comparator? (current standard of care, regulatory preference)
- Why this blinding approach? (minimize bias for subjective endpoints, or open-label acceptable for objective endpoints)
- Why this duration? (based on expected time to effect, disease natural history, similar trials)

**4.3 Justification for Dose** (30 lines):
- **For drugs:**
  - How was dose selected? (Phase 1 MTD/RP2D, Phase 2 dose-finding, PK/PD modeling)
  - Dose rationale from preclinical data (animal studies, HED calculation)
  - Dose rationale from prior clinical data (safety, efficacy signals)
  - Route and frequency rationale
  - Cite specific studies/data supporting dose choice
- **For devices:**
  - Device specifications and settings (if applicable)
  - Procedure specifications (surgical technique, implantation approach)
  - Rationale for procedure timing/frequency

**4.4 End of Study Definition** (20 lines):
- Participant completes study: When? (completion of last visit/procedure in SoA, including final follow-up)
- Study ends globally: When? (last participant completes last visit, database lock, or specific date)
- Early termination criteria: Under what circumstances might study end early? (safety concerns, futility, external data, regulatory decision, sponsor decision)

### Step 6: Write Protocol Foundation Waypoint

Create `waypoints/02_protocol_foundation.md` with:
- Title Page (from Step 4)
- Sections 1-6 (from Step 5 synthesis) in markdown format

**IMPORTANT:** This is a NEW FILE creation. Write all content starting with Title Page, followed by Sections 1-6.

Create `waypoints/02_protocol_metadata.json` with:
```json
{
  "intervention_id": "[from metadata]",
  "intervention_name": "[from metadata]",
  "protocol_version": "1.0 Draft",
  "protocol_date": "[current date]",
  "study_design": "[from Step 1]",
  "enrollment_target": "[from Step 1]",
  "primary_endpoint": "[generated in Section 4]",
  "duration_months": "[from Step 1 or generated]",
  "regulatory_pathway": "[IDE or IND]",
  "protocol_status": "foundation_complete",
  "step_2_status": "completed",
  "step_3_status": "pending",
  "step_4_status": "pending",
  "sections_completed": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
  "sections_pending": [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12],
  "notes": [
    "DRAFT for planning purposes",
    "Protocol foundation (Sections 1-6) completed",
    "Continue to Step 3 for intervention details",
    "Requires biostatistician review",
    "Requires IRB approval",

  ]
}
```

### Step 7: Display Summary

Display concise summary with:
- Intervention name, protocol version, date
- Step 2 completion status
- Title Page + Sections completed: 1-6
- Protocol foundation file created with size
- DRAFT disclaimer
- Next steps: Review protocol foundation, continue to Step 3 for intervention details (Sections 7-8)

**Example output:**
```

**NOT updated yet:**
- `waypoints/intervention_metadata.json` (will be updated after Step 4 completes)

## Error Handling

**If waypoint files missing:**
```
Error: Required waypoint files not found.
Cannot draft protocol without previous phase data.
Please run steps in order (Step 0, Step 1, then Step 2).
```

**If user declines protocol foundation:**
```
Protocol foundation skipped at user request.
Step 2 not completed - no waypoint files created.
User can return to this step later if needed.
```

**If Step 2 already completed:**
```
Warning: Phase 2 appears to be already completed.
Files exist: waypoints/02_protocol_foundation.md
Would you like to:
  1. Skip Phase 2 and continue to Phase 3
  2. Regenerate Phase 2 (will overwrite existing content)
  3. Exit
```

## Quality Checks

## Notes

- This subskill generates approximately 1,500 lines of protocol content
- Output stays well within token limits by focusing on Sections 1-6 only
- Phases 2b and 2c will append to this foundation to complete the protocol
- Protocol foundation provides the structural framework; intervention details and operational content follow in subsequent phases
