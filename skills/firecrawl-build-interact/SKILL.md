# Firecrawl Build Interact

Use this when `/scrape` is not enough because the feature needs to act on the page.

## Use This When

- content appears only after clicks, typing, or navigation
- the feature needs forms, pagination, filters, or multi-step flows
- the product must stay in the same browser context after scraping

## Default Recommendations

- Start with `/scrape`, then escalate to `/interact`.
- Keep `/interact` scoped to the smallest browser workflow that unlocks the data.
- Use persistent profiles only when the feature truly needs authenticated state across sessions.

## Common Product Patterns

- search forms and faceted filters
- paginated result sets
- login-gated dashboards or tools
- flows where the page must be explored before extraction is complete

## Implementation Notes

- `/interact` is the right tool when the page must be manipulated, not just read.
- Keep prompts or action code specific to the product flow.
- If the use case is fully open-ended browser automation, evaluate whether a browser sandbox is a better product fit.

## Escalation Rules

- If the page can be read directly, stay on [firecrawl-build-scrape](../firecrawl-build-scrape/SKILL.md).
- If you need a site-wide or section-wide extraction job, use [firecrawl-build-crawl](../firecrawl-build-crawl/SKILL.md) instead of driving one page at a time.
